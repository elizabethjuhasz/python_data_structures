# exercise 6.5

# use find and string slicing to extract portion of the string after the colon
# then use float function to convert extracted string into a floating point number

# X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475

x = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475'
point = x.find(':')
num = float(x[point+1:])
# because we want the number after the colon
print float(num)

# point = the point that I want to find 
# the prof uses 'pos' for position.
